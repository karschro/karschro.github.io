<p style="font-size: 14px; padding-top: 150px;">I'm a research scientist and engineer in applied AI, brain-computer interfaces, and computational neuroscience. I currently manage research operations at <a href="https://www.basis.ai/">Basis Research Institute</a>, where I work on meta-science for AI research.</p>

<p style="font-size: 14px;">Previously, I was a postdoc in <a href="https://churchland.zuckermaninstitute.columbia.edu/">Mark Churchland's lab</a> at Columbia's Zuckerman Institute, where we combined novel machine learning techniques with electrophysiology to demonstrate real-time BCI control algorithms in primates. 
    Before that, I was a graduate student in <a href="https://chestekresearch.engin.umich.edu/">Cindy Chestek's neuroprosthetics lab</a> at Michigan. </p>
