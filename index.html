I'm a research scientist and engineer in applied AI, brain-computer interfaces, and computational neuroscience.
<br>
I manage research operations at Basis Research Institute, where I work on meta-science for AI research. 
<br>
Previously, I was a postdoc in [Mark Churchland's lab](https://churchland.zuckermaninstitute.columbia.edu/) 
at Columbia's Zuckerman Institute, and a graduate student in [Cindy Chestek's lab](https://chestekresearch.engin.umich.edu/) 
at Michigan.
