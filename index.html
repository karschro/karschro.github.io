I'm a research scientist and engineer in applied AI, brain-computer interfaces, and computational neuroscience.

I manage research operations at Basis Research Institute, where I work on meta-science for AI research. Previously, I was a postdoc in Mark Churchland's lab at Columbia's Zuckerman Institute, and a graduate student in Cindy Chestek's lab at Michigan.
